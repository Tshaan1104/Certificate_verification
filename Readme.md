# Certificate Verification System

The **Certificate Verification System** is a web application that enables efficient management and verification of internship certificates. It allows administrators to upload student data via an Excel sheet, including essential information like certificate ID, student name, internship domain, and internship dates. Students can then search for their certificates using their unique certificate ID and download them in PDF format. The project is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to handle the backend operations and provide a seamless user experience.

### **Deployed Link**
[Certificate Verification System]()

## **Features**

### 1. **Admin Interface**
- **Excel Data Upload**: Admins can upload an Excel file containing student information (certificate ID, student name, internship domain, start date, end date). The system parses the Excel data and stores it in the MongoDB database.
- **Data Validation**: The system validates the uploaded data to ensure completeness and accuracy before storing it.

### 2. **User Interface**
- **Certificate Retrieval**: Students can search for their certificates using a unique certificate ID. The system retrieves and displays the relevant certificate details (name, internship domain, dates).
- **Certificate Display**: A certificate template is dynamically populated with the student’s information upon search, displaying a complete and professional certificate.
- **Download Option**: Students can download their certificate in PDF format after viewing it.

### 3. **Certificate Management**
- **Certificate Format**: The system features a predefined certificate format with placeholders for dynamic data. Once the student’s ID is searched, the certificate template is populated with their details.
- **Date Display**: The certificate includes the internship's start and end dates, providing all necessary information.

## **Implementation**

### **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)**

1. **API Endpoints**: 
   - RESTful API endpoints to handle operations such as data upload, retrieval, and certificate generation.
   - Endpoints for uploading Excel files, retrieving certificate details by ID, and generating downloadable certificates.
   
2. **Data Processing**:
   - Libraries like `xlsx` or `exceljs` are used to parse and process Excel files, extracting student data for storage in MongoDB.

3. **Database Integration**:
   - MongoDB is used to store student details, ensuring quick retrieval of certificate information via certificate IDs.

### **Frontend (React)**

1. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Admins can upload Excel files, view the upload status, and check logs.
   - The dashboard ensures that the admins can manage and validate the student data effectively.

2. **Student Portal**:
   - A user-friendly interface allows students to enter their certificate ID, view the populated certificate, and download it.
   
3. **Certificate Template**:
   - A React component dynamically populates the certificate template based on the data retrieved from the backend.

### **Certificate Generation**
- **PDF Creation**: 
  - Libraries like `pdfkit` or `jsPDF` are integrated into the frontend to generate certificates in PDF format. 
  - The certificate is generated based on the data retrieved from the backend and includes all relevant details in the defined format.

### **Validation & Security**
1. **Data Validation**:
   - Implement data validation checks for the uploaded Excel data to ensure integrity before storage.
   - Additional checks on the certificate retrieval process to ensure the correct certificate is displayed for each ID.

2. **User Authentication** (Optional):
   - Incorporate authentication for securing the admin and student interfaces. Admins can log in to access the admin dashboard, while students can retrieve their certificates after entering their certificate ID.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server.
  - **Express.js**: Web framework for building API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.
  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store student data.
  - **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js, used to interact with MongoDB in a structured way.

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
  - **React Router**: For handling page routing and navigation.
  - **pdf-lib / jsPDF**: Libraries for dynamically generating PDF certificates with student information.
  - **axios / fetch**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.

- **Other Libraries**:
  - **xlsx / exceljs**: Libraries for parsing Excel files.
  - **cors**: Middleware to enable cross-origin resource sharing for frontend-backend communication.
  - **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## **Installation**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Certificate-Verification-System.git
```

### 2. **Backend Setup**
- Navigate to the backend directory:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Create a `.env` file and set your environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI, JWT secret).
- Run the backend server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### 3. **Frontend Setup**
- Navigate to the frontend directory:
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- Run the frontend application:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## **Usage**

1. **Admin Panel**:
   - Log in as an admin (if authentication is enabled).
   - Upload the Excel file containing student data.
   - View the upload status and ensure that all data has been successfully processed.

2. **Student Portal**:
   - Enter the unique certificate ID in the provided search field.
   - View the dynamically populated certificate.
   - Download the certificate in PDF format.
